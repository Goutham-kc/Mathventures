## Project Description
***SIL*** is a low-cost, high-precision Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system that transforms a standard smartphone into a sophisticated vibration sensor. It utilizes real-time spectral analysis to detect structural micro-shifts and calculate the integrity of infrastructure like bridges and buildings.

## The Concept
The core idea is to measure the natural frequency of a structure—the specific rate at which it vibrates—to assess its health. Because a structure's frequency is directly linked to its stiffness, any drop in that frequency serves as an early warning sign of cracks, loose joints, or material fatigue.

Structural Mechanics ($f \propto \sqrt{k}$): We use the physical principle that the natural frequency ($f$) is proportional to the square root of stiffness ($k$). A drop in $f$ mathematically proves a loss in structural integrity.
